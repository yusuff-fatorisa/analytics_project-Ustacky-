# Project Steps



## READING THE FILES
    1]. Read individual files from the branches available
    2]. Combine all the files into a single document
    3]. Write the file back into a csv document
    4]. Read the file in back again to commence actual analysis on it.
    

## DATA EXPLORATION
    1]. Check the File quantity by inspecting the shape, rows and columns.
    2]. Inspect each of the columns available in the file and get familiarized with the information
    3]. Inspect the summary statistics of the file to have a file distribution of the data contained in the file.
    4]. Inspect for Missing Values, Duplicate Values of wrong formatted input snd values present in the file and treat them
        accordingly.
    5]. Format the Date Time columns of the file and creating new columns from them to provide more robust insights of the 
        data present in the file.


## CHECKING THE UNIQUE VALUES OF EACH COLUMN
    N.B => This is quite different from checking for duplicate values. This step allows to understand the values present in each column and how they are distributed.
    1]. Check for the unique values contained in each column
    2]. Check for the value counts of each unique values contained in each column
    3]. Get familiarized with dominant figures and distribution of the values in each column.

## DATA AGGREGATION
    1]. Choose specific columns from the data to groupby and extract aggregated statistics from the Data for deeper insights
    2]. Inspect for several occuring group or clustered behavioural patterns that is revealed for aggregated statistics.

## DATA VISUALIZATION
    1]. Use Histograms, Barcharts, Horizontal Barcharts e.t.c to understand the distribution of data in specifc columns.
    2]. Use Boxplot, KDE plot e.t.c to inspect and understand the distribution of columns in the Dataset.
    3]. Use Countplot to inspect for aggregated statistics of selected columns of the Dataset.
    N.B => The visualization process of data allows for better understanding and detection of some hidden data that might
         clearly visible while inspecting the Data manually. It also gives better understanding of the Data.
